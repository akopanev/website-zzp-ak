## Services

As an independent consultant (ZZP), I provide strategic and technical advisory services for technology companies aiming for significant growth and operational stability. My services are centered on three core pillars and are offered on a fractional or project basis.

### 1. Strategic Technology & Product Leadership

I provide fractional leadership to align your technology with core business objectives. This involves creating clear technical roadmaps, preparing your platform and teams for scale (1 to N growth), and ensuring operational stability. The goal is to build a robust foundation that supports your long-term vision.

### 2. Scalable Systems & Payments Architecture

I architect and audit the critical systems that underpin your business, with a deep specialization in payments. This includes designing for high-volume transaction processing, diversifying payment gateways to reduce risk and cost, automating manual operations, and ensuring compliance with financial regulations and card network programs.

### 3. Business & Technical Risk Mitigation

I identify and address critical failure points across your technology and operations. This service focuses on a technical analysis of your unit economics (CAC, LTV), assessing platform vulnerabilities, and implementing strategies to mitigate risks related to payments, such as high chargeback rates. This ensures your growth is both rapid and sustainable.
