## About Me

My career began in 2008 as a software engineer, evolving through technical leadership to co-founding the development agency Moqod.com.

My core expertise is bridging business goals with technical execution. While I am adept at taking products from concept to launch (0 to 1), my primary focus is on building the scalable systems and automations required for long-term growth (1 to N).

I design resilient platforms where the components work in synergy, creating compounding value where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Today, I apply this systems-thinking approach through independent consulting and fractional leadership roles.

## Core Expertise

* **Business-Tech Strategy:** Designing viable technical solutions to achieve business objectives.
* **Full Product Lifecycle (0 to N):** Leading projects from initial concept through to scalable growth.
* **Scalable Systems & Automation:** Building efficient, automated platforms designed for resilience and scale.
* **Payments Infrastructure:** Architecting and managing high-volume, global payment systems.
* **Operational & Payment Risk:** Identifying and mitigating critical technical and financial risks.

I currently serve as the CTO/CPO for Fjor Nutrition Inc., leading its technology and product strategy.
