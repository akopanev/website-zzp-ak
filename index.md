## Andrew Kopanev

**I build resilient platforms for high-growth digital businesses.**

Rapid growth exposes weak foundations. I specialize in re-architecting technology and operations for scale, turning high-risk, unstable platforms into durable, efficient enterprises.

My focus is on solving growth's most critical and complex challenges:
- **Payments & Risk:** Taming high-volume payments, mitigating VAMP, and building multi-acquirer infrastructure.
- **Platform Stability:** Eliminating technical debt and creating automated, resilient systems that support exponential growth.
- **Strategic Execution:** Translating ambitious business goals into clear, actionable technical roadmaps.

As a fractional CTO and advisor, my approach is direct, data-driven, and relentlessly focused on building systems that last.
